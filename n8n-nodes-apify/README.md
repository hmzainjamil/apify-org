---

## Self-hosted n8n: Public webhook URL for triggers

This configuration is required for our service's trigger functionality to work correctly.

By default, when running locally n8n generates webhook URLs using `localhost`, which external services cannot reach. To fix this:

1. **Set your webhook URL**  
   In the same shell or Docker environment where n8n runs, export the `WEBHOOK_URL` to a publicly-accessible address. For example:

```bash
export WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-tunnel.local"
```

2. **Restart n8n**

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Releasing a New Version

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the release process, including publishing to npm. Here's how to trigger a new release.

**Prerequisites (for all methods):**

- Ensure your target branch on GitHub is up-to-date with all changes you want to include in the release.
- Decide on the new version number, following semantic versioning (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`).
- Prepare your release notes detailing the changes.
- If you're using CLI to release, make sure you have the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).

---

## Method 1: Using the GitHub Web UI (Recommended for ease of use)

1.  **Navigate to GitHub Releases:**
    - Go to your repository's "Releases" tab

2.  **Draft a New Release:**
    - Click the **"Draft a new release"** button.

3.  **Create or Choose a Tag:**
    - In the "Choose a tag" dropdown:
      - **Type your new tag name** (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
      - If the tag doesn't exist, GitHub will prompt you with an option like **"Create new tag: v1.2.3 on publish."** Click this.
      - Ensure the **target branch** selected for creating the new tag is correct. This tag will point to the latest commit on this target branch.

4.  **Set Release Title and Notes:**
    - Set the "Release title" (e.g., `vX.Y.Z` or a more descriptive title).
    - For the release notes in the description field, you have a few options:
      - **Write your prepared release notes.**
      - **Click the "Generate release notes" button:** GitHub will attempt to automatically create release notes based on merged pull requests since the last release. You can then review and edit these auto-generated notes.

5.  **Publish the Release:**
    - Click the **"Publish release"** button.

      _Upon publishing, GitHub creates the tag from your specified branch and then creates the release. This "published" release event triggers the automated workflow._

---

## Method 2: Fully CLI-Driven Release

This method uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all steps, including tag creation.

1.  **Ensure your local target branch is synced and changes are pushed:**
    `bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
`

2.  **Create the Release (which also creates and pushes the tag):**
    Replace `vX.Y.Z` with your desired tag/version. The command will create this tag from the latest commit of your specified `--target` branch (defaults to repository's default branch, if `--target` is omitted and the branch is up to date).

    ```bash
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z" \
        --notes "Your detailed release notes here.
        - Feature X
        - Bugfix Y"

    # Or, to use notes from a file:
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z" \
        --notes-file ./RELEASE_NOTES.md

    # Or, to generate notes from pull requests (commits must follow conventional commit format for best results):
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z"
        --generate-notes
    ```

    - `vX.Y.Z`: The tag and release name.
    - `--target <branch>`: Specifies which branch the tag should be created from (e.g., `master`). If the tag `vX.Y.Z` doesn't exist, `gh` will create it based on the HEAD of this target branch and push it.
    - `--title "<title>"`: The title for your release.
    - `--notes "<notes>"` or `--notes-file <filepath>` or `--generate-notes`: Your release notes.

      _This command will create the tag, push it to GitHub, and then publish the release. This "published" release event triggers the automated workflow._

---

## Post-Release: Automated Workflow & Verification (Common to all methods)

Regardless of how you create and publish the GitHub Release:

1.  **Automated Workflow Execution:**
    - The "Release & Publish" GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger.
    - It will perform:
      1.  Code checkout.
      2.  Version extraction (`X.Y.Z`) from the release tag.
      3.  Build and test processes.
      4.  Update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to version `X.Y.Z`.
      5.  Commit these version changes back to the branch the release was targeted from with a message like `chore(release): set version to X.Y.Z [skip ci]`.
      6.  Publish the package `@apify/n8n-nodes-apify@X.Y.Z` to npm.

2.  **Verify the Package on npm:**
    After the workflow successfully completes (check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository): - Verify the new version on npm:
    `bash
npm view @apify/n8n-nodes-apify version
`
    This should print `X.Y.Z`.
